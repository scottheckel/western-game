western-game
============

A little top-down western themed game created in **two hours** using Quintus (http://www.html5quintus.com) and Gamepads.js (http://www.github.com/scottheckel/gamepads.js).  Shoot all of the enemies before they can take you out.  There's a random amount of enemies, so you may need to hunt around for them.
